# JavaScript-Question

1. Create an array of numbers. Add one element to the end using push() and one to the
beginning using unshift(). Print the final array.
2. Create an array of 5 fruits. Remove the last element using pop() and the first element
using shift(). Print the modified array.
3. Create an array [10, 20, 30, 40]. Use splice() to remove 20 and insert 25 at
the same index. Print the result.
4. Create an array of 4 colors. Use join('-') to convert the array into a single string and
print it.
5. Use toString() on an array [100, 200, 300] and print the result.
ðŸ”¹ Accessing and Copying
6. Create an array [5, 10, 15, 20]. Use .at(-1) to access the last element and print
it.
7. Use copyWithin() to copy the first 2 elements of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] into the last 2
positions. Print the result.
8. Create a nested array [1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]]. Use flat(2) to flatten it
completely. Print the result.
9. Use slice() to copy the middle two elements of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. Print the
result.
10. Use concat() to merge two arrays [1, 2] and [3, 4]. Print the final array.
ðŸ”¹ Delete / Replace / Immutability
11. Create an array of 5 numbers. Use the delete operator to delete the 2nd index value.
Print the array and its length.
12. Use toSpliced() to remove the second element of an array [9, 8, 7, 6] and
insert 10, 11 at that position. Print original and new array.
13. Create an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Use splice() to remove last 2 elements and
print the resulting array.
14. Make a copy of [7, 8, 9] and insert 6 at the beginning using unshift() without
modifying the original array.
15. Write a function that accepts an array and returns a string of all elements joined with ' |
'.
ðŸ”¹ Practice-Oriented Scenarios
16. Create a function that returns the last item of an array using only .length.
17. Write a function to return the 2nd last element using .at() method.
18. Create a function to reverse an array without using reverse() method (use
unshift() inside a loop).
19. Flatten a 2D array like [[1,2],[3,4]] using .flat() and return it.
20. Given two arrays, one of names and one of marks, return a combined array of string
format like ["Ram: 80", "Shyam: 90"] using join() and loop.
